# Wizard RougeLike

Rouge-like inspired by games such as Binding of Issac, Hades, and Dead Cells.
The game will feature randomly generated dungeon floors that the player must explore while fighting various enemies and bosses as the player traverses them in order to rescue the prince from the Archwizard.
This is both an excersize on practicing art by creating my own art assets while furthering what I can do as a designer.
